# The FlexMeasures Project

The *FlexMeasures Platform* is the intelligent & developer-friendly EMS (energy management system) to support real-time energy flexibility apps, rapidly and scalable. 

In a nutshell, FlexMeasures turns data into optimized schedules for flexible assets like batteries and heat pumps, or for flexible industry processes:

FlexMeasures is part of [the Linux Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org/). It's project page is [here](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/flexmeasures/). 

There is more documentation in [the main FlexMeasures repository](https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures). That is probably where you want to head first. Or head right to [our ReadTheDocs page](https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io).

Here, you'll also find other repositories which support the project, like the website, notes about the governance (TSC for "Technical Steering Committee) or plugin template tooling.
